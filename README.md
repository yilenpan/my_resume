# Hello World

Hello! Welcome to my process for building this site. This is
the first time I've ever built anything with Facebook's
React/Flux architechture, so this will be a learning process.
This site will include routing and hopefully making calls
to a python based back-end. All the code will be up on my
github.

I've gone ahead and whiteboarded out what it is I want this
website to look like. Next is to head to balsamiq to do this
mock up in a png.

I picked a color palette that I like. It's called Sa Barca de
Formetera. It's a dark grey, grey, teal, white, yellow combo.

Dark Grey -> #333333
Grey -> #424242
Teal -> #00CCD6
White -> #EFEFEF
Yellow -> #FFD900
